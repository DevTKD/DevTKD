👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tanya (@DevTKD)

I’m a paralegal and contract manager with 15+ years of experience in analytical problem-solving, risk assessment, and working in highly regulated environments—now intentionally transitioning into technology-focused roles spanning software development, quality engineering, and data-aware systems.

🐍 I started my technical journey with Python, building small backend-oriented projects that strengthened my understanding of programming logic, data handling, and real-world problem modeling. I’m currently learning Java, which has become a key focus as I build a stronger foundation in structured, scalable application development.

🧠 I’m particularly interested in how data is structured, analyzed, and responsibly used, and how emerging AI-enabled systems can support better decision-making when paired with strong governance and thoughtful design. My background in privacy, compliance, and contractual risk informs how I approach technology—especially systems that handle sensitive data.

💛 I’m working toward roles that blend backend development, test automation, and system reliability, with growing exposure to Java-based tooling, backend and API testing concepts, SQL validation, and workflow automation.

🌱 Always learning, always building—using personal projects to experiment, break things safely, and strengthen my technical foundations while bringing a human-centered, risk-aware mindset into engineering work.
