👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tanya (@DevTKD)

I’m a longtime paralegal and contract manager with 18+ years in analytical problem-solving, risk awareness, and highly regulated environments.

But the deeper truth?

My heart lives in Apple development and the journey toward becoming a successful indie developer. I care about building software that is calm, precise, beautifully designed, and genuinely useful—especially within the Apple ecosystem.

🍏 What Drives Me
* A deep love for iOS and macOS development
* The dream of creating meaningful, profitable indie apps
* Thoughtful software design over noisy, bloated tech
* Systems that are reliable, elegant, and human-centered

I’m not here just to code.
I’m here to build things that matter—and to create a future defined by creativity, ownership, and freedom.

🐍 Technical Interests
* Swift & SwiftUI — Apple-native app experiences
* Python — automation, validation, and intelligent tooling
* Quality, reliability, and structured system thinking
* Backend logic and data-driven workflows

My projects are steps toward a single outcome:

A sustainable life as an indie Apple developer.

🌱 Right Now
I’m building, learning, and sharpening my skills—one real project at a time—while moving steadily toward launching apps that can stand on their own.

No shortcuts.
No pretending.
Just progress.
