- 💻 Current Focus: Immersed in a full stack developer bootcamp, mastering both frontend and backend technologies.
- 🐍 Love for Python: Passionate about coding in Python, my language of choice, even though I have experience with other programming languages like JavaScript.
- 🔧 Passion for Backend: While I'm gaining full stack skills, my heart is set on backend development, where I can build robust and efficient systems.
- 🌱 Always Learning: Excited to expand my programming knowledge, in the future, with languages like PHP, and even COBOL for that old-school expertise!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an introvert with a few extrovert moments 🤭 and my favorite color is yellow!

I may be new to software development, but my confidence in my coding skills grows with every line of code I write. Join me on this exciting journey as I transition from the legal world to the tech landscape, eager to make a mark and bring about meaningful change.
