👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tanya (@DevTKD)

I’m a paralegal and contract manager with 18+ years of experience in analytical problem-solving, risk assessment, and highly regulated environments.

I’m intentionally transitioning into Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and quality-focused engineering roles, where correctness, reliability, and confidence in systems matter.

My focus is on engineering how software is tested — not just writing test cases — with strong interests in test strategy, automation, and system reliability aimed at preventing failures before they reach production.

☕🐍 Technical Focus
  * Java — primary focus for automated testing and structured test frameworks (JUnit)
  * Python — test tooling, logic modeling, data validation, and experimentation
  * SQL — validating data correctness and system behavior
  * Backend and API testing concepts
  * Growing exposure to CI/CD and workflow automation

My projects are designed to explore edge cases, expected vs. actual behavior, and system-level confidence.

🧠 Perspective & Interests

I’m especially interested in:
  * Data structure, validation, and responsible use
  * Quality and testing in data-driven and AI-enabled systems
  * Automation paired with governance and trust

My legal background brings a risk-aware, human-centered lens to engineering and quality work.

🌱 Current Goal

To grow into an SDET and automation QA subject-matter expert through hands-on projects that strengthen testing foundations, automation design, and multi-language fluency.
