- 💻 Current Focus: Learning PHP & Python.
- 🔧 Backend Development Passion: While I've gained full-stack skills, my true passion lies in backend development, where I enjoy building robust and efficient systems.
- 🌱 Always Learning: Continuously expanding my knowledge, with plans to explore languages like Java and even COBOL for that old-school expertise!
