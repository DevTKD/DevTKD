👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tanya (@DevTKD)
  
I’m a paralegal and contract manager with over 15 years of analytical problem-solving experience, now fully transitioning into software development & QA Engineering. I’m currently diving deep into Java, and it’s quickly become the language that truly speaks to me — structured, powerful, and perfect for building beautiful, enterprise-grade systems.

🐍 My journey started with Python, and along the way I’ve also worked with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and even Swift. Each language taught me something valuable, but Java is where everything finally clicked, and it’s now the foundation of my long-term engineering path.

💛 I’m working toward becoming an Automated QA Engineer, focusing on Java-based test automation, backend and API testing, SQL validation, and enterprise-scale test frameworks. My mission is to improve system reliability through automation, thoughtful test architecture, and human-centered quality engineering.

🌱 I’m always learning, exploring different languages and technologies, but Java remains my core focus as I grow into enterprise development.

😄 My pronouns are She/Her.

⚡ Fun facts: I’m an introvert with occasional extrovert bursts 🤭, my favorite color is yellow, and I’m a devoted K-drama watcher on Netflix 🤭.

Thanks for stopping by — join me as I build, break, learn, and grow on this journey from the legal field into the world of software engineering!
