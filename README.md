👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tanya (@DevTKD)
  
A bit about me:
- 🔍 Background: Over 15 years of experience as a paralegal and contract manager, known for a keen eye for detail, problem-solving skills, and now transitioning into the tech world.
- 💻 Current Focus: Expanding my knowledge of Python and SQL in order to develop robust, scalable applications and enhance backend development skills.
- 🧠 Tech Journey: Completed a full stack web development bootcamp where I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more. While I don’t use JavaScript every day, I’m familiar with the language and its ecosystem.
- 🌱 Always Learning: I am always open to learning new things. I plan to explore languages like Go, Java and even COBOL for that old-school expertise!
- 🌟 Mission: To use my tech skills to create impactful, life-changing solutions and APIs.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact(s): I'm an introvert with a few extrovert moments 🤭, my favorite color is yellow and I love watching Korean drama series on Netflix 🤭!

I may be new to software development, but my confidence in my coding skills grows with every line of code I write. Join me on this exciting journey as I transition from the legal world to the tech landscape, eager to make a mark and bring about meaningful change.
